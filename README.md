# Weather-Dashboard
The motivation behind building this application was to learn how to use and implement third party API's.
This application allows the user to search for their city and find the weather and five day forecast. While building this application I learned how to fetch third party API's, and use the information provided to create a responsive appication.
## Usage
To use this application simply type a city in the search box and click the search button. The current weather as well as the five day forecast will load. If the user wants to look at multiple cities their searches are saved under the dropdown icon.
